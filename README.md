# CMPEN482W-Combined

Nearly all of our changes were made in the file: src/FaceTrackingRenderer2D.cpp within the DrawPoseAndPulse function. Changes made by us elsewhere are not useful/critical for the project.

Note: 
- For the mouse to be able to click on the on-screen-keyboard, the application must be running in Administrator mode.
- We think the process runs multi-threaded, which made some variables to be set unpredictably. The software runs well, but if any issues occur while running, its multi-threadedness could be the source of the issue.
